"# Programmer-Analyst-Assignment" 

Here is the prompt that I followed for this assignment: 
- Build up a simple React app using whichever plugins, packages, or resources you'd like.
- Use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users as a dummy API.
- Create a list of contact cards based on the API that will display the contact's name, email, and phone number.
- Include a spot for a profile picture to be added later.
- Clicking on the user's name should either take you to a new page or open a pop up that contains the user's remaining data.
- Zip code should only contain the first 5 digits.
- The 'website' URL should be clickable.
- Push the app to GitHub and share the repository.



To run this application, you must have node and npm installed on your computer. 
If you haven't already, change directories to contact-cards
Run the command "npm start" from this directory. 
The app will run on "http://localhost:3000/"
